## Labels are important

Let's take a look at the labels on the AdaFruit feather that I got:

1. Adafruit Feather
2. nRF52840
3. Bluefruit logo
4. Feather logo 

The labels on the [web site](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-the-adafruit-nrf52840-feather):

1. Adafruit nRF52840
2. Bluefruit Feather
3. CircuitPython support
4. UF2 bootloader
5. Featherwings



## Setup is shockingly 

The board uses three LEDs to communicate status. There isn't a handy table to say what each of them does.
