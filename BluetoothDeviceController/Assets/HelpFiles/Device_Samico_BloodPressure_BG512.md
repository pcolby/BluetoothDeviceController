# Pyle PHBPBW40, Samico and Bough Tech BG512 Blood Pressure Cuff

![Cuff](../DevicePictures/Samico_BloodPressure_BG512-175.png)

This is a wrist blood-pressure cuff. While running it provides a constant read-out of the cuff pressure
and when finished will show the systolic and diastolic values and your pulse rate.

# Using

The blood pressure cuff does not normally need to be paired. When you click on the üè• icon, the page for the cuff will display and the pressure readings will start automatically. The cuff will cut off the BlueTooth connection very quickly when it's done; you'll have to re-select the üè• to restart it.
